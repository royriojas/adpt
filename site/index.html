              <h1>About Kidapt</h1>
              <p>
                Kidapt, Inc. is an innovative media company dedicated to using post-PC device technology,
                smart storytelling, and research-based curriculum in partnership with Stanford University
                Researchers to create entertaining and fun content that helps children learn.
                Our character-based episodic vignettes will initially center around pre-school-aged children,
                engaging them with puzzles and games interwoven within an immersive story arc that drives
                kindergarten preparedness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Subsequently our platform will expand to address prevailing issues facing the over 42 million "early learners"
                (PreK-6 ages 3-11) in the US. We believe that parents of these early learners, who often share smartphones,
                tablets and other connected devices with their children, are searching for a richer, more
                complete outlet that they can rely on to both entertain and educate.

              <h1>About Leo's Pad</h1>
              <p>
                Our first offering, Leo's Pad, is based on Leonardo Da Vinci as an 8 year old and a cadre of kid characters, each a playfully re-imagined historical figure, including Gally (Galileo), Shakes (Shakespeare), Flo (Florence Nightingale), etc. Through Leo's Pad we seek to deliver an evergreen subscription service to children and parents, representing much more than the typical single purpose apps that currently exist.

                      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                      <h2>Dan Danko</h2><h3>Creative Director</h3>
                    </hgroup>
                    <p>
Born in Los Angeles, California, Dan Danko attributes his success in the entertainment industry to his childhood belief that he’s from another planet. To this day, he has yet to be proven wrong.<br/>
After graduating from CSUN with a B.A. in English, Dan spent several years writing and editing comic books for Malibu and Marvel Comics. Although he enjoyed writing stories about heroes in Spandex and villains (most likely not in Spandex) pounding each other with the fate of the Earth in the balance, he sought deeper meaning in his own life and thus found his way into the world of television where he has written for shows as diverse as “Malcolm in the Middle” and “Rugrats.” In addition to being head writer on Nickelodeon’s “Fresh Beat Band,” Dan won an Emmy for his work on PBS’ “Word World.”<br/>
Dan recently created the live-action series “Leonardo” for BBC Kids, which follows the fantastical adventures of a teenage Leonardo DaVinci in Renaissance Florence. Dan is currently typing away as the head writer for Nicktoons’ “Wild Grinders” as well as working with Jim Henson Productions on their live-action program, “Pajanimals.”<br/>
In addition to head writing over 500 episodes of animated TV, Dan has developed shows as diverse as “The DaVincibles,” “Teenage Fairy Tale Dropouts,” “Pet Alien,” “Leonardo” and “SuperNormal” for international broadcast. With an eye on the global market, Dan has guided multiple properties from concept to broadcast in worldwide territories.<br/>
If asked, Dan will quickly list one of his greatest accomplishments as being fluent enough in Japanese to speak to a dim-witted seven-year-old. If Dan isn’t watching Lakers’ games or inventing new ways to lose money in the stock market, you’ll find him traveling to any country that has a traveler’s advisory from the U.S. State Department – much to his mother’s dismay.
