              <h1>About Kidapt</h1>
              <p>
                Kidapt, Inc. is an innovative media company dedicated to using post-PC device technology,
                smart storytelling, and research-based curriculum in partnership with Stanford University
                Researchers to create entertaining and fun content that helps children learn.
                Our character-based episodic vignettes will initially center around pre-school-aged children,
                engaging them with puzzles and games interwoven within an immersive story arc that drives
                kindergarten preparedness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Subsequently our platform will expand to address prevailing issues facing the over 42 million "early learners"
                (PreK-6 ages 3-11) in the US. We believe that parents of these early learners, who often share smartphones,
                tablets and other connected devices with their children, are searching for a richer, more
                complete outlet that they can rely on to both entertain and educate.

              <h1>About Leo's Pad</h1>
              <p>
                Our first offering, Leo's Pad, is based on Leonardo Da Vinci as an 8 year old and a cadre of kid characters, each a playfully re-imagined historical figure, including Gally (Galileo), Shakes (Shakespeare), Flo (Florence Nightingale), etc. Through Leo's Pad we seek to deliver an evergreen subscription service to children and parents, representing much more than the typical single purpose apps that currently exist.

                      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
