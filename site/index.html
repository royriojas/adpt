              <h1>About Kidapt</h1>
              <p>
                Kidapt is an innovative media and technology company dedicated to
                using post-PC devices, smart storytelling, and a curriculum developed
                in consultation with Stanford University researchers to create
                entertaining and adaptive content that helps children learn.  Our
                first product, Leo's Pad, will engage preschool-aged children with
                games, puzzles, and projects woven into an immersive story arc.  Our
                technology will use embedded assessments to customize learning,
                support metacognitive development, and provide parents with actionable
                intelligence and useful tips about how to further support their
                child's progress and interests.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our platform will ultimately expand to address the entire "early
                learning" market (ages 3-11), both in and out of school.  We will
                entertain and educate these children with a product pipeline that will
                support them and their parents (and eventually teachers) through the
                children's entire early-learning trajectory.

              <h1>About Leo's Pad</h1>
              <p>
                Our first offering, Leo's Pad, is based on Leonardo Da Vinci as an 8-year-old
                and his group of friends, each a playfully re-imagined
                historical figure, including Gally (Galileo), Shakes (Shakespeare),
                Flo (Florence Nightingale), etc.  Through Leo's Pad we will deliver an
                evergreen service to children and parents, representing a much richer
                and more sustained experience than the typical single-purpose apps
                that currently exist.
